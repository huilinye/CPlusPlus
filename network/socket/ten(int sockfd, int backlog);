[1mNAME[0m
       listen - listen for connections on a socket

[1mLIBRARY[0m
       Standard C library ([4mlibc[24m, [4m-lc[24m)

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/socket.h>[0m

       [1mint listen(int [4m[22msockfd[24m[1m, int [4m[22mbacklog[24m[1m);[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mlisten[22m() marks the socket referred to by [4msockfd[24m as a passive socket, that is, as a socket that will be used to accept incoming connection requests using [1maccept[22m(2).

       The [4msockfd[24m argument is a file descriptor that refers to a socket of type [1mSOCK_STREAM [22mor [1mSOCK_SEQPACKET[22m.

       The  [4mbacklog[24m  argument  defines  the  maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for [4msockfd[24m may grow.  If a connection request arrives when the queue is full, the
       client may receive an error with an indication of [1mECONNREFUSED [22mor, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be ignored so that a later  reattempt  at
       connection succeeds.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mEADDRINUSE[0m
              Another socket is already listening on the same port.

       [1mEADDRINUSE[0m
              (Internet  domain  sockets) The socket referred to by [4msockfd[24m had not previously been bound to an address and, upon attempting to bind it to an ephemeral port, it was de‚Äê
              termined that all port numbers in the ephemeral port range are currently in use.  See the discussion of [4m/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range[24m in [1mip[22m(7).

       [1mEBADF  [22mThe argument [4msockfd[24m is not a valid file descriptor.

       [1mENOTSOCK[0m
              The file descriptor [4msockfd[24m does not refer to a socket.

       [1mEOPNOTSUPP[0m
              The socket is not of a type that supports the [1mlisten[22m() operation.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD ([1mlisten[22m() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

[1mNOTES[0m
       To accept connections, the following steps are performed:

           (1)  A socket is created with [1msocket[22m(2).

           (2)  The socket is bound to a local address using [1mbind[22m(2), so that other sockets may be [1mconnect[22m(2)ed to it.

           (3)  A willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for incoming connections are specified with [1mlisten[22m().

           (4)  Connections are accepted with [1maccept[22m(2).

       The behavior of the [4mbacklog[24m argument on TCP sockets changed with Linux 2.2.  Now it specifies the queue length for [4mcompletely[24m established sockets waiting to  be  accepted,  in‚Äê
       stead  of  the  number of incomplete connection requests.  The maximum length of the queue for incomplete sockets can be set using [4m/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog[24m.  When
       syncookies are enabled there is no logical maximum length and this setting is ignored.  See [1mtcp[22m(7) for more information.

       If the [4mbacklog[24m argument is greater than the value in [4m/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn[24m, then it is silently capped to that value.  Since Linux 5.4, the default in this file is 4096;
       in earlier kernels, the default value is 128.  Before Linux 2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value, [1mSOMAXCONN[22m, with the value 128.
